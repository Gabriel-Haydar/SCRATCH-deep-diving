# SCRATCH-deep-diving
This is a Scratch project called Deep Diving with Giovanna &amp; Vithinho. It was created for week 0 of Harvard's CS50X course. The character from the game are my wife and my little brother-in-law, respectively.  The soundtrack is from Subnautica. Many assets are from craftpix.net, and sound effects are from freesound.org.
